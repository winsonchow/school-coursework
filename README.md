## Coursework 2: CIFAR10 Image Classification

### Project Description
This project is an exploration into image classificatio using the CIFAR-10 dataset with PyTorch. It aims to develop a convolutional neural network that can accurately classify images into one of the ten categories

### Model Architecture
The model uses a sequence of convolutional layers, ReLU activation functions, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers to process and classify images.

### Results
The model achieved a classification accuracy of 80% on the test set.
